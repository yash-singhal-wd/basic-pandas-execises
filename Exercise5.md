# Exercise 5: Website Traffic – Time Series Analysis

## 📌 Objective

Learn basic time-series operations like date filtering, resampling, and rolling statistics.

## 📊 Dataset

A dataset of daily page views over a 90-day period with:

- `Date`: Date of observation (daily frequency)
- `Page_Views`: Number of page views on that day

## ✅ Tasks

1. Plot the daily `Page_Views` as a line chart.
2. Resample the data weekly and calculate average weekly views.
3. Filter the dataset to show only data from **February 2023**.
4. Add a column with a **7-day rolling average** of `Page_Views`.

## ⭐ Bonus Challenge

- Identify the week with the highest average page views.
- Highlight spikes (days with views > 1.5× rolling average).
