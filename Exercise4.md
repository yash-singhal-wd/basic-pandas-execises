# Exercise 4: Customer Orders – String Operations & Filtering

## 📌 Objective

Practice working with string data, filtering rows, and analyzing orders.

## 📊 Dataset

A dataset of 20 customer orders with the following columns:

- `Customer`: Customer name
- `Email`: Email address
- `Order_ID`: Unique order ID
- `Status`: Order status (Shipped, Pending, Cancelled)
- `Order_Value`: Order value in USD

## ✅ Tasks

1. Filter and show only the **Shipped** orders.
2. Show customers whose `Order_Value` is **above the average**.
3. Extract the customer and domain name from the `Email` column.
4. Count the number of orders by status.

## ⭐ Bonus Challenge

- Create a bar chart showing the number of orders by status.
- Add a column that marks if the order is “High Value” (value > $700).
